        "I wanted to learn Python because I was interested in how it could be used to solve business problems in the real world when I first started learning business programming. The class started with computational thinking, which is necessary to solve problems in a planned way and make complicated issues easier to understand. Our teacher made the lessons fun so that we could learn Python code, data types, and how to convert from binary to decimal. At first, it was hard for me to put ideas into practice, but my professor's help made me realise how important it is to combine theory and practice.\n",
        "We learned about the six basic processes a computer can do and the different types of data it can hold. We also learned how to break problems down into simple steps, create formulas, and write them in code. A big focus on functions helped handle complexity by grouping jobs together, making code easier to read, encouraging code reuse, and making it easier for people to work together.\n",
        "We learned how to handle errors, validate input, and read and write to and from files, all of which are important skills for keeping programmes safe and stable. These methods make business software more reliable and useful. Module design and file handling lessons made the value of code that works well and can be used again and again clear. Modular design breaks down complicated programmes into parts that are easier to handle. File processing, especially with CSV files, teaches useful skills for working with data.\n",
        "We also paid a lot of attention to thorough testing methods, which are important for worker trust and the user experience. Testing makes sure that the software is good and that users are happy, which is very important for business solutions that work. This focus on testing made me realise how important it is for making reliable apps, which inspired me to keep learning and improving my computer skills.\n"
